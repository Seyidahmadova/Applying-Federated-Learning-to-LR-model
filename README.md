# Applying-Federated-Learning-to-LR-model

I applied Federated Learning to Logistic Regression model and used Heart Disease Dataset. Dataset divided into 5 datasets and I used Logistic Regression for training these datasets.

Results:

accuracy rose from 81% to 94% in the first dataset.

For the second dataset accuracy was 86% before applying the averaged model after applying the averaged model, accuracy increased by more than 86% in some iterations, but overall, for the 500 iterations, accuracy was 86% once more.
